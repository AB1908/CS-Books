# README

This repository is intended to create and maintain a comprehensive list of textbooks and useful references for a Computer Science and Engineering Curriculum. This is an ongoing effort, and contributions, though welcome, need to abide by the contributing guidelines so as to maintain order. In case you wish to contribute, please find the PR template at [contribution.md](contribution.md). The current default branch is `dev`, which will be built upon, whereas `master` will eventually contain a complete curriculum.

# CS Curriculum Textbooks and References

Being an avid book reader, I have found it rather difficult to find a comprehensive list of textbooks to use for reference and for self learning. I have, therefore, set out to create and share it for all who wish to find the same. I have also linked courses that I could find across the web, most often the links from the first two pages of Googling, so that one may find a relevant guide to the particular course. All linked course pages often have one more additional references should the reader wish to engage in more depth with the topic at hand. This list is by no means comprehensive, though it is an eventual target. There are also video lectures of many of courses which are better located at [Computer Science courses with video lectures](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses).
