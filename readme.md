# README

This repository is to aggregate a comprehensive list of textbooks and useful references for a Computer Science and Engineering Curriculum. This is an ongoing effort, and contributions are not welcome at the time. As this is in a very early stage, most of the structure and/or layout has not been decided and will be changed as seen fit. As of now, content below is also present in its separate file labeled Curriculum.

# CS Curriculum, Textbooks and References

All linked course pages often have one more more additional references should the reader wish to engage in more depth with the topic at hand. This least is by no means comprehensive, though it is an eventual target. There are also video lectures of many of courses that may or may not be linked which are better located at [GitHub link for CS video courses]().

## Operating Systems

### Alternative/Supplementary

1. **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** - Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau (*The Black Book*/*The Asteroid Book*/*The Comet Book*) [3]
2. **Schaumâ€™s Outline of Operating Systems** - Archer J. Harris
3. **The Design of the UNIX operating system** - Maurice J. Bach
4. **Operating Systems: Principles and Practice** - Thomas Anderson and Michael Dahlin. [4]
5. **Operating Systems: A Concept-Based Approach** - D. M. Dhamdhere
6. **Operating Systems: A Modern Perspective** - Gary J. Nutt
7. **Operating Systems In Depth: Design and Programming** - Thomas W. Doeppner [5]
8. **Operating System Concepts Essentials** - Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne [6]

### Notes

For a more historical approach, [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_computer_science#Operating_systems) provides a list of a series of breakthroughs in Operating System Design. [A list of research papers on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud156-readings) may also be useful, and are the recommended readings for [CS 6210 at GATech](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6210-advanced-operating-systems).

[1] - Used as the reference book for [CS 385 at UIC](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/), [CM's 15-410](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/), [CS 347 at IITB](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/teaching/cs347_autumn2016/index.html) where reading through MIT's [xv6 Operating System](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) is mandatory, [Drexel's CS 543](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jjohnson/2012-13/fall/cs543/) which again recommends reading **Linux Kernel Development**, [CS170 at UCSB](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/class/cs170/).

[2] - Used as a reference for [TOM-2.1-CS at UT](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~pieter/CS-OS/), recomennded textbook for [CS 372 at UT Austin](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/372/) although certain readings are from [1] as well.

[3] - [**OSTEP**](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) was made as a book to a course on Operating Systems, which is [freely available](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/). The professors also recommend reading classic texts such as **Linux Kernel Development** and **The C Programming Language** (K&R). It is also used as a reference for [WPI's CS 3013](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cshue/cs3013/). It is also my personal recommendation for an introduction to Operating Systems.

[4] - Used as the reference book for [SU's CS140](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring18/index.php), [Yale's CS422/522](http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/).

[5] - Used as a mandatory reference book for [CS 161 at HU](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cs161/).

[6] - Basically a cheaper version of [1] recommended as the reference textbook for [CU's COMS W4118](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4118/).
