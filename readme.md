# README

This repository is to create a comprehensive list of textbooks and useful references for a Computer Science and Engineering Curriculum. This is an ongoing effort, and contributions are not welcome at the time. As this is in a very early stage, most of the structure and/or layout has not been decided and will be changed as seen fit. As of now, content below is also present in its separate file labeled Curriculum.

# CS Curriculum, Textbooks and References

Being an avid book reader, I have found it rather difficult to find a comprehensive list of textbooks to use for reference and for self learning. I have, therefore, set out to create and share it for all who wish to find the same. I have also linked courses that I could find across the web, most often the links from the first two pages of Googling, so that one may find a relevant guide to the particular course. All linked course pages often have one more additional references should the reader wish to engage in more depth with the topic at hand. This list is by no means comprehensive, though it is an eventual target. There are also video lectures of many of courses that may or may not be linked which are better located at [GitHub link for CS video courses](). The current default branch is `dev`, which will be built upon, whereas `master` will eventually contain a complete curriculum.

### Notes

For a more historical approach, [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_computer_science#Operating_systems) provides a list of a series of breakthroughs in Operating System Design. [A list of research papers on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud156-readings) may also be useful, and are the recommended readings for [CS 6210 at GATech](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6210-advanced-operating-systems).

[1] - Used as the reference for

- [CS 385 at UIC](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)
- [CM's 15-410](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/)
- [CS 347 at IITB](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/teaching/cs347_autumn2016/index.html) where reading through MIT's [xv6 Operating System](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) is mandatory.
- [Drexel's CS 543](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jjohnson/2012-13/fall/cs543/) which again recommends reading **Linux Kernel Development**.
- [CS170 at UCSB](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/class/cs170/)

[2] - Used as the reference for

- [TOM-2.1-CS at UT](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~pieter/CS-OS/)
- [CS 372 at UT Austin](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/372/) although certain readings are from [1] as well.

[3] - [**OSTEP**](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) was made as a companion for a [course on Operating Systems at UWISC](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/), which is freely available. The professors also recommend reading classic texts such as **Linux Kernel Development** and **The C Programming Language** (K&R). It is also used as a reference for [WPI's CS 3013](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cshue/cs3013/). It is also my personal recommendation for an introduction to Operating Systems.

[4] - Used as the reference for

- [SU's CS140](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring18/index.php)
- [Yale's CS422/522](http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/)

[5] - Used as the reference for
- [CS 161 at HU](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cs161/)

[6] - Basically a cheaper version of [1] recommended as the reference textbook for [CU's COMS W4118](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4118/).
