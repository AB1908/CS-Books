# Contributing to CS Resources

First off, thanks for contributing to this book list (which is probably just as lame as it sounds)! Although suggestions are welcome from everyone and in every form, it needs to follow a little structure unless the end-goal is to descend into a chaotic list of books with no care for organisation. Apart from books, there's a host of other things to keep in mind when contributing to this repository (I know, I know, it's just a list).

### Code of Conduct

This repository follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. By any form of participation, the contributor is expected to uphold the aforementioned code. Any unacceptable behaviour may be reported to `abhishekbhattacherjee@live.com`

### Why Contribute?

In the [readme](readme.md/#cs-curriculum-textbooks-and-references), I had described that I was unable to find a suitable list of books to learn subject matter from. It is therefore the goal of this repository, not only for me but for anyone interested in any topic of Computer Science, to have a comprehensive list of textbooks to refer to. Such a list would be a great way to point to the sources that people already in the field use(d).

Apart from that, I also found a frustrating problem that has happened more than a few times now. My curriculum constantly recommended some book (obviously in the best interests of the curriculum) only for me to find out halfway through reading it that there's another _way_ better book that blows the current one out of the water, whereupon I no longer have enough time to complete the book that I want to. I hope that stops happening to me and everyone else out there. Hopefully, this is sufficient motivation for YOU to contribute to this repository! Go ahead to the next section!

### Ways to Contribute

It is pretty obvious that the list will not suit everyone's taste, so contribution is strongly encouraged. A diverse opinion would only be better for future readers.

#### I want to suggest spelling, formatting, grammar errors, or basically anything that isn't related to books or material!

Go right ahead! Open an issue describing it and it'll be addressed, so long as you follow the [Issue Template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). You sure as hell can expect your name in the **Contributors** list.  

#### I want to suggest a book!

Thank God you're here! Don't hesitate at all! Although it'd be great if you've read the book yourself and have thoughts to share, it's not necessary. Now there's two ways this could go :

- **The book you're suggesting isn't listed**
  - Money! If it falls under an existing topic, go ahead and submit a Pull Request. But before that, remember that I like order. It makes our lives much easier. So, take a moment and go through the [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
  - If it's from a topic not listed, you may have hit the jackpot here! If you're lazy like me and only want to suggest a book, submit a Pull Request following the [template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as mentioned before. But if you've got more than just a book to offer, [see below](#i-want-to-add-an-entire-topic).


- **The book you're suggesting is listed**
  - Don't worry! I still would like to hear your experience. You can also suggest relevant resources, courses linked on the web, perhaps your personal notes you made while studying, the possibilities are endless. Personal notes have not been categorised as of now. A [relevant issue discussing the matter]() has been opened. Join the discussion if you have ideas!

#### I want to add an entire topic!

You. I love you. You can go ahead and create a Pull Request to add the whole damn thing, keeping the [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) in mind. Have a cookie. But make sure you're careful enough to follow the template properly. With great power comes great responsibility!

#### I want to suggest better ways to organise this list!

Come to papa! You might have noticed that this project doesn't have a fancy discussion channel, so come submit your ideas over at [Issue #](). Hopefully, it'll be a big help!

#### I want to do something not listed above!

Well, er, submit an issue and (hopefully) follow up with a pull request? The kinds of issues I expect to see here are contributions towards the "Community Docs", but I expect surprises.

#### Note

It is strongly recommended that the book(s) suggested be suitable to approach the majority of the topic they fall under. Such a responsibility is left to discretion of the contributor. See [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for further details.

### Pull Request and Issue Templates

You can find the pull request template over [here](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). The issue template is over [here](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

The main sections of the templates are

### Style Guide

The formatting styles for issues and pull requests are described in the templates linked above. Apart from those, I would also strongly encourage good commit messages in adherence to the following:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

If you're unfamiliar with Git in general, I'd recommend reading through the [Official Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book).
