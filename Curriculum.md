### Notes

- This topic includes a significant overlap with the one on [Algorithm Design and Analysis](#algorithm-design-and-analysis). Many concepts carry over from this topic and one may find it useful to study them side-by-side. Many of the courses linked also may not follow a similar syllabus and may be at higher level than intended.
- There are numerous amounts of online resources including lecture videos. Such a list may be found elsewhere. An online [Learning Assistant with Animations](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~csonline/DataStructures/Lessons/index.html) on VT's website may be useful for visualisation and explanation of certain concepts. Daniel Liang has also created some relevant animations which can be found [here](http://cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/animation.html). USFCA also [hosts a visualiser](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/about.html) on their website and also includes instructions to create one.
- [PLDS210 at UA](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/software/AlgAnim/ds_ToC.html) does not have a particular reference textbook. Instead it uses a combination of many books as a source for lecture notes. Each topic has it's own list of references, which are the recommended material instead of the lecture notes.
- [CMU's 15-111](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-111-kesden/) uses an [online textbook](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clo/www/CMU/DataStructures/).
- [CS 61BL at Berkeley](https://sp18.datastructur.es/) uses a [set of free notes](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/) by the instructor for the first half, and **Algorithms** by Sedgewick and Wayne for the second half.
- [Data Structures and Algorithms (Level 1/C) at UoB](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/dsa.html) recommends using 3 free ebooks linked on the course page.

### Notes

There are plenty more books than listed and more courses than I'd care to link.

<a id="CAHP" href="#CAHPref">^</a>1 - Widely regarded as an authoritative reference for Computer Organisation and Architecture. It is written by Turing Award winning Computer Scientists David Patterson and John Hennessy, but also assumes the reader is already well versed with concepts of Computer Architecture. For the beginner, [^](#CODHPref)2 is widely recommended as _the_ book to start with. Used as a reference for

- [CS146 at Harvard](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dbrooks/cs146-spring2004/)

<a id="CODHP" href="#CODHPref">^</a>2 - [TYCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#architecture) recommends this excellent book (after going through **The Elements of Computing Systems** by Nishan and Schocken) for an introduction to the fundamental ideas of Computer Organisation and Architecture. It is extremely well written, has plenty of depth, and is built upon in [^](#CAHPref)1 by the same authors. Used as a reference for

- [CS 312 at UMSL](http://www.cs.umsl.edu/~sanjiv/classes/cs312/)
- [ECE 411 at UI](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE411)

- [18-447 at CMU](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece447/s13/doku.php?id=schedule) along with [^](#ITCPref)8
- [CS 3410 at Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2016fa/)
- [CS 61C at Berkeley](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs61c/sp15/#Resources)

<a id="CSA" href="#CSAref">^</a>4 - I didn't find this book stimulating at all.

<a id="COA" href="#COAref">^</a>6 - I found this book incredibly dull and difficult to understand. Good luck.

<a id="CSPP" href="#CSPPref">^</a>7 - Used as the reference for

2. **Algorithm Design** - Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos (*KT*) <sup id="KTref">[[2]](#KT)</sup>
3. **Algorithms** - Christos Papadimitriou, Sanjoy Dasgupta, and Umesh Vazirani (*DPV*) <sup id="DPVref">[[3]](#DPV)</sup>

### Alternative/Supplementary

1. **The Algorithm Design Manual** - Steven Skiena <sup id="ADMref">[[4]](#ADM)</sup>
2. **Algorithms** - Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne <sup id="ASWref">[[5]](ASW#)</sup>
3. **Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach** - Udi Manber <sup id="IAACAref">[[6]](#IAACA)</sup>

8. **Algorithms in a Nutshell: A Practical Guide** - George T. Heineman and Gary Pollice
9. **Algorithm Design: Foundations, Analysis and Internet Examples** - Michael T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia

### Notes

- Algorithms are a vast topic and merit their own course altogether due to there being many subtopics such as randomised, parallel, approximation and so on, each having entire textbooks on them. This particular topic is meant to serve as an introduction to each subtopic by focusing on the underlying principles used in designing the algorithm. There are many MOOCs to cater to students, again linked [here]().
- There are, again, numerous resources on the web related to the topic and if a major course related to it hasn't made it to the list, contributions are extremely welcome.
- [CSC2420 at UoT](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/2420f12/) does not use a single source. Instead it uses a combination of [^](#CLRSref)1, [^](#DPVref)3 and [^](#KTref)2.
- [5] is used as the basis for [Sedgewick and Wayne's online course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/teach/algorithms-part1) with a [second part](https://www.coursera.org/teach/algorithms-part2).
- [^](#KTref)2 has a revised version of slides to accompany the textbook available [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/).
- [Algorithms, Etc. by Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) is a set of notes that covers the material necessary for his course at University of Illinois.
- *TAOCP* also serves as a useful reference for many algorithms typically studied as part of an undergraduate level course. It is quite mathematical so typically many students find it a hard read.

<a id="CLRS" href="#CLRSref">^</a>1 - Typically used as an encyclopedic reference for most topic, rather than an introduction to algorithms. Used as the reference for

- [CS 600 A at SIT](https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~swetzel/CS600/spring11/)
- [15-451/651 at CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15451/) which also recommends [^](#DPVref)3 but either can be used, while an [older version](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f09/index.html) has it's own set of notes
- [CS 466/666 at UoW Canada](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eblais/courses/F17/CS466/) with [additional material](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eblais/courses/F17/CS466/outline.pdf)

- [CS 7820 at Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6820/2009fa/) taken by **Jon Kleinberg**

<a id="DPV" href="#DPVref">^</a>3 - Used as the reference for

- [CS 157 at Brown](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs157/)

<a id="ADM" href="#ADMref">^</a>4 - Recommended by [TYCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms). Used as the reference for

### Notes

- Compiler Design also has much historical background which can be better read through by following [Wikipedia's Compiler Publication List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_computer_science#Compilers) and also [Wikipedia's History of compiler construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_compiler_construction), which has further reading described at the end.
- GitHub also has a list of [Awesome Compiler resources](https://github.com/aalhour/awesome-compilers) and even more [additional resources](https://github.com/berkerpeksag/notes/tree/master/learning/compilers).
