### Notes

There are plenty more books than listed and more courses than I'd care to link.

[1] - Widely regarded as an authoritative reference for Computer Organisation and Architecture. It is written by Turing Award winning Computer Scientists David Patterson and John Hennessy, but also assumes the reader is already well versed with concepts of Computer Architecture. For the beginner, [2] is widely recommended as _the_ book to start with. Used as a reference for

- [CS146 at Harvard](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dbrooks/cs146-spring2004/)

[2] - [TYCS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#architecture) recommends this excellent book (after going through **The Elements of Computing Systems** by Nishan and Schocken), as do I, for an introduction to the fundamental ideas of Computer Organisation and Architecture. It is extremely well written, has plenty of depth, and is built upon in [1] by the same authors. Used as a reference for

- [CS 312 at UMSL](http://www.cs.umsl.edu/~sanjiv/classes/cs312/)
- [ECE 411 at UI](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE411)
- [B62006Y-01 at ](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/admission/undergraduate/course-syllabuses/620-school-of-computer-and-control-engineering/4471-principles-of-computer-organization) (Note: Syllabus page only)
- [18-447 at CMU](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece447/s13/doku.php?id=schedule) along with [8]
- [CS 3410 at Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2016fa/)
- [CS 61C at Berkeley](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs61c/sp15/#Resources)

[4] - I didn't find this book stimulating at all.

[6] - I found this book incredibly dull and difficult to understand. Good luck.

[7] - Used as the reference for

- [CS 2505 at VT](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs2505/spring2018/)

### Notes

For a more historical approach, [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_computer_science#Operating_systems) provides a list of a series of breakthroughs in Operating System Design. [A list of research papers on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud156-readings) may also be useful, and are the recommended readings for [CS 6210 at GATech](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6210-advanced-operating-systems).

[1] - Used as the reference for

- [CS 385 at UIC](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)
- [CM's 15-410](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/)
- [CS 347 at IITB](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/teaching/cs347_autumn2016/index.html) where reading through MIT's [xv6 Operating System](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) is mandatory.
- [Drexel's CS 543](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jjohnson/2012-13/fall/cs543/) which again recommends reading **Linux Kernel Development**.

The professors also recommend reading classic texts such as **Linux Kernel Development** and **The C Programming Language** (K&R). It is also used as a reference for [WPI's CS 3013](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cshue/cs3013/). Apart from being my personal recommendation for an introduction to Operating Systems, it is also recommended over at [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/£oeprating-systems)(_TYCS_).
