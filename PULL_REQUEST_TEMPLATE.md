Note that the three spaces before text with two spaces at the end allows for paragraphs without line breaks (if this is unclear, you may want to brush up on your [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). 

The "**References**" section already exists, so make sure you add it in the correct place. Also, don't forget to add the topic heading in [readme.md](readme.md) as well as [Curriculum.md](Curriculum.md)!
