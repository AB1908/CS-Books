Kindly follow the template below for creating a new curriculum. Note that the three spaces before text with two spaces at the end allows for paragraphs without line breaks. Also, don't forget to add the topic heading in readme.md as well as Curriculum.md! (If this is unclear, you may want to brush up on your [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))

In case you wish to modify this template, submit an issue first as changes (if accepted) need to be made to all parts of the curriculum.
